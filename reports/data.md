# information about dataset

### Force Data (`force.csv`):

- Contains **6 features**:
  - `FP1_x`, `FP2_x`, `FP1_y`, `FP2_y`, `FP1_z`, `FP2_z`
  - Represent the ground reaction forces (in 3 axes: x, y, z) for two force plates.

### Marker Data (`marker.csv`):

- Contains **24 features**:
  - `L_FCC_x`, `L_FM1_x`, ..., `R_FM5_z`
  - Represent the 3D positions of markers placed on the left (L) and right (R) foot in three axes (x, y, z).

### Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

We will proceed with the following steps:

1. **Preprocessing**:

   - Combine both datasets to create a unified feature set.
   - Normalize/scale the data to ensure all features are on the same scale.

2. **Feature Engineering**:

   - Add aggregated features (e.g., average force, magnitude of marker movements).
   - Drop any unnecessary or redundant features.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train a **binary classification model**:
     - Define labels: Generate a synthetic binary label for demonstration (e.g., "Normal" vs. "Abnormal").
   - Evaluate the model performance.

The preprocessing is complete, and the dataset is now ready for modeling. Here's what we achieved so far:

1. **Combined Features**:
   - Concatenated force and marker data into a single dataset with 30 features.
2. **Generated Labels**:

   - Created a synthetic binary label (`Normal=1`, `Abnormal=0`) for demonstration purposes.

3. **Scaled Features**:
   - Standardized all features to ensure they are on a comparable scale.

### **Simulated Labels:**

I generated synthetic labels (Stance, Swing, Toe-off) since no actual gait phase labels are available.

The purpose of assigning meaningful labels like `'Slow'`, `'Medium'`, and `'Fast'` to datasets (`force_0_6`, `force_0_7`, and `force_0_8`) in gait phase analysis is to provide **class labels** for supervised learning. This approach allows the model to distinguish between different walking speeds or conditions and predict these states when new data is provided. Here's why and how this concept applies to gait phase analysis:

---

### **Purpose**

1. **Supervised Learning**:

   - In machine learning, supervised models require labeled data for training. By assigning `'Slow'`, `'Medium'`, and `'Fast'` as labels, we create a classification problem for the model to learn.
   - The model uses the force data (features) to predict the associated gait phase (labels).

2. **Representation of Walking Conditions**:

   - Gait analysis often examines variations in walking patterns under different conditions. Here, walking speeds (`Slow`, `Medium`, `Fast`) can represent distinct gait phases or states.

3. **Data Organization**:

   - These labels help organize the datasets by walking speed, making the analysis and training process more structured.

4. **Application in Real Scenarios**:
   - In real-world gait analysis, you might classify data into phases like `'Stance'`, `'Swing'`, and `'Toe-off'`, or analyze walking conditions under different speeds or terrains. Assigning labels is a foundational step in such analyses.

### **Is This Relevant to Gait Phase Analysis?**

Yes, but with some adjustments:

- **Gait Phases**:

  - Actual gait phase analysis often involves classifying or predicting specific phases of the gait cycle, such as:
    - **Stance Phase**: When the foot is in contact with the ground.
    - **Swing Phase**: When the foot is in motion.
    - **Toe-off Phase**: The transition between stance and swing.
  - The labels `'Slow'`, `'Medium'`, `'Fast'` in this example simulate walking speeds, which indirectly affect gait characteristics.

- **Walking Speed and Gait**:

  - Walking speed is a critical parameter in gait analysis. It directly influences stride length, ground reaction forces, and phase durations. By analyzing data under different speeds (`Slow`, `Medium`, `Fast`), we can capture speed-dependent variations in gait.

- **Extension to Real Data**:
  - Instead of `'Slow'`, `'Medium'`, `'Fast'`, the labels in real gait analysis may correspond to specific phases (`Stance`, `Swing`, etc.) or pathologies (`Normal`, `Abnormal Gait`).

---

### **Key Considerations**

If you are working on gait phase analysis:

1. **Ensure Relevant Labels**:

   - If your goal is phase classification (e.g., `'Stance'`, `'Swing'`), ensure you have labeled data reflecting these phases.
   - If working with walking speed, `'Slow'`, `'Medium'`, `'Fast'` are valid.

2. **Data Source**:

   - The dataset should align with the analysis objective. For instance:
     - Kinematic data (e.g., joint angles) is used for phase analysis.
     - Force data (e.g., ground reaction forces) is used for load and phase transition analysis.

3. **Extend the Labels**:
   - Incorporate clinical or biomechanical context to analyze abnormal vs. normal gait, rehabilitation progress, or pathological states.

---

### **Conclusion**

Assigning labels like `'Slow'`, `'Medium'`, `'Fast'` is a simplification for training a machine learning model in the example. In actual gait phase analysis, you may use more specific and clinically relevant labels based on the phases of the gait cycle or other parameters of interest.
